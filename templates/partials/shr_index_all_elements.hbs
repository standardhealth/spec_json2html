  <h2>
    The Standard Health Record is a rapidly evolving specification under active development. Ultimately, an individual's SHR will consist of a series of entries relevant to the health of that person. The entries are divided among the categories below, and each <a href="http://standardhealthrecord.org/shr/base/index.html#Entry">entry</a> always includes basic information about itself (e.g. who created it and when). Click on the data elements below to explore details of the Standard Health Record. Go to <a href="https://github.com/standardhealth" style="font-weight: 600;">the SHR GitHub</a> or <a href="mailto:shr-project-list@lists.mitre.org" style="font-weight: 600;">email the collaborative</a> to get involved.
