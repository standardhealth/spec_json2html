# Architecture Description:

##Architecture Overview:
#### Technologies Used:
Below are a list of the technologies used to build the SSVE:

- [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/), the JavaScript Runtime we use.
- [GruntJs](http://gruntjs.com/), the JavaScript task runner we use.
- [Assemble.io](http://assemble.io/), a static site generator for Grunt.js and Node.js, building pages wiht HandlebarsJS.
- [HandlebarsJs](http://handlebarsjs.com/), a logicless templating language we use to generate views for the website.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), the Node.js testing framwork we use.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), a JavaScript library enabling quick navigation and manipulation of HTML.


#### Tool Pipeline:

- Env Variables: Defined within `_config.yml`, used to guarantee variable agreement across files.
- Task Running: Grunt contains a series of tasks defined to manage the functionality of the project.
    - buildNamespacePages(): Accesses external hierarchy and separates namespaces into their own pages to be generated
    - clean: Wipes the `dist` directory to insure that, at the end of a task run, the directory's only contents are the product of the current task
    - assemble: Contains instructions for building all of the separate pages, partitioned into two subtasks:
        - pages: Builds a page for each of the namespace objects generates in buildNamespacePages()
        - home: Builds index.html, a general navigation view for the hierarchy
    - mochaTest: Runs a series of tests located in the `test.js` file on the pages generated by assemble.


#### Directory Organization:
Below you willl find the structure of folders, with a brief description of what they contain:
```
